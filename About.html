      <h1 class="w3-center">Purpose of My Website</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-center">Srujana Damarla, MS in Information Science</h5>
      <p class="w3-large">Watching movies has always been one of the most opted means of entertainment. I personally enjoy watching movies and shows in my free time. I always depend on various online sources to decide which movie I should watch. These sources have always been helpful and would contain a variety of movies and shows divided into various categories. However, they usually have much more information than what I would need which would make me go through a lot of content before I reach my required information. So having this in mind I wanted to design a website that would satisfy my needs and respond to my concerns. Also, I would be more than glad to expand my website to meet the requirements of other movies lovers ike me. </p>

    <h1>Outcome and Challenges of the Course</h1>
	<p class="w3-large">I have always been inclined towards web designing, so I started learning HTML on my own referring to various sources online mainly w3school. My interest and zeal to learn more about web designing lead me to enroll in this course. I was never able to fully understand the concept of CSS before this course. Now I not only enhanced my HTML skills but also fully understood how to add essence to the site using CSS. I would like to further enhance my knowledge in CSS and expertise in it and other similar languages. In the future, I would apply this knowledge in learning more advanced web developing languages. I would also like to work more on this website to add additional features and add a professional look to it. I believe this would allow me to add this website in my portfolio, thereby helping me achieve my career goals. Almost all the lessons in this course were easy to understand and apply, the only ones I felt difficult and time taking to apply were forms and layouts. The modules in the course are well structured, however I feel the modules would be more effective if they could be more descriptive and explanatory. Dr. Tyson has also been very supportive and encouraged his students to learn more. He ensures that students prioritize to learning rather than concentrating on scoring good grades. My overall journey through this course was pleasant and the knowledge that I gained will help me throughout my professional life.</p>
